
Snake 11

Now the logic of mouse control.
Two things will happen to the mouse with us.
First - the snake eats the mouse.
Second - a new mouse appears at a random point in the room.
You must write and implement the createMouse () method in the Room class.
In this method, we just have to create a new mouse with random coordinates in the room.
How to get random coordinates?
You should have known that already. Just in case, I give a hint:
int x = (int) (Math.random () * width);
Still need a method - eatMouse (), in case the mouse still someone eats.
While there will be no complex logic in this method, we just call the createMouse method and thatâ€™s it.
